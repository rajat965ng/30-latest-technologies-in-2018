Chapter 8: Boundaries

	-- A cleaner way to use Map might look like the following. No user of Sensors would care one bit if generics were used or not. That 
		choice has become (and always should be) an implementation detail.

		public class Sensors {
			private Map sensors = new HashMap();
			public Sensor getById(String id) {
				return (Sensor) sensors.get(id);
			}
			//snip
		}

		We are not suggesting that every use of Map be encapsulated in this form. Rather, we are advising you not to pass Map s (or any other interface at a boundary) around your system. If you use a boundary interface like Map , keep it inside the class, or close family of classes, where it is used. Avoid returning it from, or accepting it as an argument to, public APIs.
