This repository will contain at least 30 latest/new technologies that I'm going to learn in 2018 

Purpose: To eliminate the fear of unknown

1. ReactJs
2. Scala (core) : 2.12.4
3. Parallel Computing (Java 8)
4. Apache Spark 2.2.1 (for Machine Learning, Graph Processing and Data Streaming) + Hive (Data warehousing for distributing        storage using SQL) using R-Programming and Scala 
5. Design Patterns (Java)
6. Java 8 (Latest features)
7. SASS (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets)
8. ES6 (ECMAScript 6)

{{
MongoDB,
Express:provide a framework to set up our Node.js server.,
React,
Node
},{
Axios: let us use HTTP methods to communicate with our database,
Express: provide a framework to set up our Node.js server,
Body Parser: parse the incoming requests bodies for the info we are sending (gives us access to `req.body` which we will be using soon),
Foreman: allows us to boot up our API and webpack-dev-server simultaneously,
Nodemon: watches our server.js file for changes, then restarts it,
Marked: to convert markdown syntax to html. I used this in place of Remarkable (which the FB tutorial uses),
Mongoose: abstracts away the MongoDB boilerplate for a simple Schema solution.
} }
