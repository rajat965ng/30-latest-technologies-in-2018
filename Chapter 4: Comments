Chapter 4: Comments

	-- One of the more common motivations for writing comments is bad code. Clear and expressive code with few comments is far 
		superior to cluttered and complex code with lots of comments.
	-- Sometimes it is useful to warn other pro-grammers about certain consequences. For example, here is a comment that explains
		why a particular test case is turned off.
	-- It is sometimes reasonable to leave “To do” notes in the form of //TODO comments. In the following case, the TODO comment 
		explains why the function has a degenerate implementa-tion and what that function’s future should be.
		//TODO-MdM these are not needed
		// We expect this to go away when we do the checkout model
		protected VersionInfo makeVersion() throws Exception
		{
		return null;
		}
