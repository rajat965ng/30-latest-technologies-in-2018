Chapter 15: JUnit Internals


	-- Every line of code, every if statement and for loop, is executed by the tests. This gives me a high 
		degree of confidence that the code works and a high degree of respect for the craftsmanship of the authors.

	-- The Boy Scout Rule
		It’s not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over time. We’ve all
		seen code rot and degrade as time passes. So we must take an active role in preventing this 
		degradation.

		The Boy Scouts of America have a simple rule that we can apply to our profession.

		Leave the campground cleaner than you found it. 

		If we all checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, the code simply could not rot.
